### 🖤 about me 2 -- useless facts:
- I like seafood. Any seafood. My favorite food is sushi and the only seafood I don't like (that I've tried) is packaged tuna.
- My favorite overall Persona character is Kotone Shiomi/FeMC, my second favorite is Yosuke Hanamura, and my third is Futaba Sakura.
- I have a fascination with operating systems. I've installed like... 7 different Linux distros on my little tester laptop. (It's old, can't do much.) Right now, it's running Endeavour OS. Arch didn't work. I had issues with the Display Manager. I don't use Arch btw :(
- If you ever see me in public being oddly consumed by the screen of a graphing calculator, I'm probably playing some old GBC game. Probably The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening.
